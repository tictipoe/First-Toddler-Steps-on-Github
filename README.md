# First-Toddler-Steps-on-Github
testing and learning
this text seems to be inside the file README.md  - whatever is .md ?
now this was edited online on Github.com - being logged in.

how then get this 'pulled' to local ?

Remote repo seems set to be this thingy where this file is.
this seems to be a 'master' branch.

locally i am at 'master' (of local i guess) and cannot pull because i have to merge something ??!?!? wtf

so hey  . this is a sad beginning :)
